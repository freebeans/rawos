My attempt to learn how operating systems works. Feel free to fork this.


#### Why
I've been wanting to learn how operating systems work.
I mainly use GNU/Linux both at work and home, but diving in to the source code seemed a bit pretentious.

Thus I'm following some tutorials I find on the Internet and commiting my work here for personal use mostly.


#### How

I'm following these tutorials:

- [**The little book about OS development**](https://littleosbook.github.io/) by [*Erik Helin*](https://github.com/helino) and [*Adam Renberg*](https://github.com/tgwizard)

- [**OS Development Tutorials**](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxEVubjFScbApy_2zSOQo3UBEfSJQ-lhM) by [*Codepixl*](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCce5fC7TvN4lkIi0-v3SMVQ)

Also, there's the **OSDev** [**Wiki**](http://wiki.osdev.org) and [**Forum**](http://forum.osdev.org/). I highly recommend taking a look at the Wiki. It contains more than 600 articles.
